      "content": "Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaldu]; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi Professional League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards[note 3] and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 32 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals in the European Championship (14), international goals (123) and international appearances (200). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,100 professional career appearances, and has scored over 800 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the highest goal-scorer of all time according to the IFFHS. He is the only player to score in five different FIFA World Cup tournaments. Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four Champions League wins from 2014 to 2018, including La Décima. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, three UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player and became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his contract was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr. Ronaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned 200 caps, making him Portugal's most-capped player. With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also the all-time top goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in and scored at eleven major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement would see him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020.",

      "content": "Born in Zadar,[8] Modrić's childhood coincided with the Croatian War of Independence which displaced his family. In 2002, he was signed by Dinamo Zagreb at age 16, after showing promise with his hometown club NK Zadar's youth team. He continued his development in Zagreb, before spells on loan to Zrinjski Mostar and Inter Zaprešić. He made his debut for Dinamo in 2005 and won three consecutive league titles and domestic cups, being named the Prva HNL Player of the Year in 2007. In 2008, he moved to Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur for a club-record transfer fee of £16.5 million, where he led Spurs to their first UEFA Champions League appearance in almost 50 years, reaching the quarter-finals of the 2010–11 tournament. In the summer of 2012, Modrić joined Real Madrid for a £30 million transfer fee. There he became a key contributor and helped the team win La Décima and was selected for the 2013–14 Champions League squad of the season. After Zinedine Zidane took over Madrid, Modrić was critical to three consecutive Champions League titles from 2015–16 to 2017–18, each time being voted into the squad of the season. He has won twenty-three major trophies at Real Madrid, including five UEFA Champions League titles, three La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey titles, four Supercopa de España titles, four UEFA Super Cup titles and five FIFA Club World Cup titles. He won the La Liga Award for \"Best Midfielder\" in 2016 for the second time, and the UEFA Club Football Award for \"Best Midfielder\" in 2017 and 2018. In 2015, he became the first Croatian player to be included in the FIFA FIFPRO World 11, in which he was regularly included until 2019 and then again in 2022, as well in the UEFA Team of the Year between 2016 and 2018. In 2018, Modrić became the first Croatian player to win the UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award, and by winning The Best FIFA Men's Player and Ballon d'Or awards, he became the first player other than Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo to claim the awards in more than a decade. In 2019, he was awarded the Golden Foot award for career results and personality. Modrić made his international debut for Croatia against Argentina in March 2006, and scored his first international goal in a friendly match against Italy. Modrić has anchored Croatia's \"second Golden Generation\", participating in every major tournament Croatia has qualified for, including the UEFA Euro 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020, as well as the 2006, 2014, 2018, and 2022 FIFA World Cup. At the Euro 2008, he was selected for the Team of the Tournament, becoming only the second Croatian to ever achieve this honour. Following group stage eliminations in his first two World Cups, Modrić led Croatia to the 2018 World Cup Final, winning the Golden Ball in process. At the following tournament, he led the team to a third-place finish, winning the Bronze Ball in process. In March 2021, he went on to become the country's most capped player in history. Furthermore, he has been named Croatian Footballer of the Year a record eleven times between 2007 and 2022.",

      "content": "Benzema is a footballer of his time. He has dreamed of the Ballon d'Or since he was a child. At 34 years old, the Real Madrid striker has finally put his hands on the object of desire, which he was awarded with great pomp during a ceremony at the Châtelet Theater in Paris, Monday, October 17. While others have already begun an inexorable decline at the same age, the Frenchman is currently at the pinnacle of his art. Never has he been so strong, so decisive as in his 18th professional season. In the Champions League, he led his team to the title earlier this year. It was his fifth, but this one bears his signature, having scored 15 goals.\n\nThroughout his troubled career, Benzema has embodied the refusal to accept defeat, even when his team was (often) destined for it. With him, the Ballon d'Or has ended up once again on a striker's mantelpiece, but his victory marks a break from Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, who have privatized the award since 2008 (with the exception of Luka Modric in 2018) in a long duel of ego and statistics.",

      "title": "Real Madrid",
      "author": "Ammar",
      "content": "Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for \"royal\" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 81,044-capacity Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting entities, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. The official Madrid anthem is the \"Hala Madrid y nada más\", written by RedOne and Manuel Jabois.[6] The club is one of the most widely supported in the world, and is the most followed football club on social media according to the CIES Football Observatory as of 2023[7][8] and was estimated to be worth $5.1 billion in 2022, making it the world's most valuable football club.[9] In 2023, it was the second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of €713.8 million.[10]\n\nBeing one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably El Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning twelve league titles in the span of 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Francisco Gento, and Raymond Kopa, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest of all time.[11][12] Real Madrid is known for its Galácticos policy, which involves signing the world's best players, such as Ronaldo, Zidane, and David Beckham, to create a superstar team.[13] The term ‘Galácticos policy’ generally refers to the two eras of Florentino Pérez’s presidency of the club (2000-2006 and 2009-2018), however, players brought in just before his tenure are sometimes considered to be part of the Galácticos legacy. A notable example is Steve McManaman, who like many other players also suffered under the policy.[14] On 26 June 2009, Madrid signed Cristiano Ronaldo for a record breaking £80 million (€94 million);[15] he became both the club and history's all-time top goalscorer.[16][17][18][19] Madrid have recently relaxed the Galácticos policy, instead focusing on signing young talents such as Vinícius Júnior and Jude Bellingham.[20]\n\nIn domestic football, the club has won 69 trophies; a record 35 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey, 12 Supercopa de España, a Copa Eva Duarte, and a Copa de la Liga.[21] In European football, Real Madrid have won a record 21 trophies;[note 1] a record 14 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, two UEFA Cups, and a record[note 2] five UEFA Super Cups. In worldwide competitions, they have achieved a record eight club world championships.[note 3] Madrid was ranked second in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 2000, 2002, 2014, 2017.[27] In UEFA, Madrid ranks 1st in the all-time club ranking.[28][29]\n\nReal Madrid was recognised as the best football club of the 20th century by FIFA and as the best European club during the same timeframe by the IFFHS,[30] whilst also receiving the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in 2004.[31]Real Madrid has the highest participations in the European Cup/Champions League (42),[32] tournament in which they hold the overall record for the most wins, most draws and most goals scored.[33] Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (three-peat) in the European Cup/Champions League twice, first in 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58, and second in 2015–16, 2016–17, and 2017–18. In May 2022, they won a record-extending fourteenth Champions League title (the fifth in nine seasons), recognized by the Guinness World Records.[34] Real Madrid is the first club across all of Europe's top five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions.[35] As of March 2023, Real Madrid are ranked fifth in the UEFA club rankings.[36]",
